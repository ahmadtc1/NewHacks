## Usage
feed.me is as easy as 1, 2, 3...

Through feed.me's simple and easy to use user interface, users can snap a picture of their receipt on their phone, and then submit it. Once their picture is submitted, our backend logic takes care of using OCR to digitize the text and upload the ingredients to our server's database, where the ingredients are then used to return appropriate recipes to our users right back on their phone
